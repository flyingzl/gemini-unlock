cargo install gemini-unlock
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flyingzl/gemini-unlock.git
cd gemini-unlock
cargo install --path .
```

---

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Apply patches (Chrome must be closed)
gemini-unlock

# Automatically close Chrome before patching
gemini-unlock -k

# Restore from backup
gemini-unlock -r

# Show help
gemini-unlock --help

# Enable debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug gemini-unlock
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--kill-chrome` | `-k` | Close running Chrome before applying patches |
| `--restore` | `-r` | Restore Local State from backup instead of patching |
| `--help` | `-h` | Print help information |
| `--version` | — | Print version information |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `RUST_LOG=info` | Enable info-level logging (default) |
| `RUST_LOG=debug` | Enable debug-level logging |
| `RUST_LOG=warn` | Enable only warnings |
| `RUST_LOG=error` | Enable only errors |

## ⚠️ Important Requirements

Before using this tool, make sure to configure the following:

### 1. Chrome Language Settings
Set Google Chrome's language to **English**:
1. Open Chrome settings
2. Go to **Languages** section
3. Set **Display Google Chrome in this language** to **English**
4. Relaunch Chrome

### 2. Proxy Configuration
Configure your VPN/proxy tool to use **United States** region:
- Set your proxy location to US servers
- Ensure the proxy is active before using Gemini features
- Some features may require a US IP address to function properly

**Why these requirements?**
While this tool modifies Chrome's configuration to indicate US region, Google's servers may perform additional checks. Using US language settings and a US proxy helps ensure maximum compatibility with Gemini features.

---

## 🔧 How it Works

This tool modifies Chrome's Local State configuration file to enable Gemini features by:

1. **Detecting** your operating system and Chrome config location
2. **Backing up** your original Local State file (as `Local State.bak`)
3. **Patching** specific configuration fields:
   - `is_glic_eligible`: `false` → `true`
   - `variations_country`: `<current>` → `"us"`
   - `variations_permanent_consistency_country`: `<current>` → `["us"]`
4. **Validating** the modified JSON to ensure Chrome can read it
5. **Logging** all operations for debugging

### Why This Works

Chrome checks these configuration fields to determine Gemini availability. By setting them to US region values, Gemini features become unlocked even if you're in a different region.

**Important Notes:**
- This only modifies local configuration
- No network requests are made
- No data is sent to external servers
- Changes are reversible via the `--restore` flag

## 🏗️ Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85.0 or later (with Rust 2024 edition support)
- Cargo

### Build Commands

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- --help
```

The release binary will be at `target/release/gemini-unlock`.

---

## 🧪 Testing

We maintain 100% test coverage with 22+ tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_complete_patch_workflow

# Show test coverage (requires tarpaulin)
cargo tarpaulin --out Html
```

Test suites include:
- **Unit Tests**: 13 tests for core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 8 tests for end-to-end workflows
- **Documentation Tests**: 1 test for code examples

---

## 📁 File Locations

The tool operates on Chrome's Local State file:

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Local State` |
| **Linux** | `~/.config/google-chrome/Local State` |
| **Windows** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Local State` |

A backup is created as `Local State.bak` in the same directory.

## 🛡️ Safety

This tool is designed with safety in mind:

- ✅ **Type-Safe JSON Parsing**
  - Uses `serde_json`, not regex
- ✅ **Input Validation**
  - Verifies JSON before and after modification
- ✅ **Automatic Backups**
  - Creates `.bak` file before changes
- ✅ **Process Detection**
  - Refuses to run if Chrome is open
- ✅ **Zero Network**
  - No external connections
- ✅ **Open Source**
  - Fully auditable code
- ✅ **Reversible**
  - Easy restore with `--restore` flag

## 💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by and built upon ideas from:
- **[Gemini-in-Chrome](https://github.com/appsail/Gemini-in-Chrome)** by appsail
  - Original concept and implementation

Special thanks to the original author for the pioneering work on enabling Chrome Gemini features. This Rust implementation aims to provide a safer, cross-platform, and more maintainable solution with comprehensive testing and type-safe JSON handling.
